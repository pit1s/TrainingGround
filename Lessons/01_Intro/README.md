###Lesson 01

This is just to get familiar with the basics, strings, numbers, types, etc.
Each file has several examples, with instruction commented out using Python's comment character
(`#`), meaning the characters on that follow are ignored by the Python interpreter, which reads
through the program, executing valid code as it works it's way to the end.

I recommend using https://repl.it/languages/python3 along with the lessons, copy and pasting each
code block into the editor on the left, and clicking 'Run'. The output will show up on the right.
You can use this to tinker with the code itself as well, or just as a visual aid. You can also copy
the entire file into the editor, but it is preferred to go step by step.

Any questions, let me know.
